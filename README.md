# projetoGameIPOO
This repository consists of parts of the project Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, an important concept that I have studied in the Information Systems program at the Federal University of Lavras. The purpose of this project is to test my skills as a Java developer by creating a 2D game using all the content covered in class.
